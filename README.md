### Explanation of Study

When Varroa infestations are high in the fall, it is important to rapidly reduce the infestations. We hypothesized that a *combination* treatment with Apiguard (active ingredient: thymol) and Apivar(ai: amitraz) could meet the treatment requirements that beekeepers often need in the fall. To test this hypothesis, we performed a field trial in which colonies received either Apivar, Amitraz E.C., or the *combination* treatment. As our key response variables, we monitored Varroa infestation rates and colony strength parameters.

This experiment took place in a single apiary in Auburn, Alabama in Fall 2020 (treatments applied September 23, 2020).
